# Python For Literature

This repository stores a Python script that explores the text of a novel. It is designed to share approaches that users can use to analyze text (especially literature) using Python. 

The script covers the following topics:
1. Extracting and tokenizing text data from a PDF
2. Creating wordclouds
3. Separating chapter titles from sentences
4. Analyzing sentiments of sentences
5. Lemmatizing text
6. Identifying "character-adjacent" verbs and adjectives in a novel
7. Identifying parts of speech
8. Plotting word occurrences over the course of a novel

If you have any questions or suggestions on ways to analyze the text of novels using Python, feel free to email me at patrick.ml.walsh@gmail.com.
